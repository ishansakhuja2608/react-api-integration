# API Integration Project

This project demonstrates API integration using the `fetch()` method. Initially, the following operations have been implemented:

- **GET**
- **PUT**
- **DELETE**

## Features

- View data retrieved from the API (GET).
- Update data via the API (PUT).
- View the data that was updated previously.
- Delete records using the API (DELETE).

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### Frontend

1. First, clone this repository to your local system and open the project in your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
2. Navigate to the project folder where the frontend code is located.
3. Install the frontend dependencies by running the installation command (`npm i`) in your terminal.
4. To start the frontend server, execute the development server command (`npm run dev`) to serve the project locally.

### Backend

1. Navigate to the `backend` folder from the project root directory.
2. Install the backend dependencies using the installation command (`npm i`) for this directory.
3. Start the backend server by running the command `node app.js`.

## Usage

- Once the frontend and backend servers are running, open the frontend application in your browser.
- Use the application interface to interact with the API for operations like viewing, updating, or deleting data.

This project can be extended by implementing additional API operations, improving the UI, or adding better error handling. Feel free to contribute or use it as a base for your projects!
